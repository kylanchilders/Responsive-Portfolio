                I was born and raised in Skagit County, WA and attended Burlington-Edison High School before attending ITT Technical Institude in Everett for my Associates Degree in Computer Networking. Upon graduation, I moved to Bellingham, WA. I am currently attending University of Washington's full stack coding bootcamp while working full time.

                After graduating, I bounced around a couple short term website technical support jobs before settling it at Hemisphere Solutions, a startup managed IT service provider where I work as the Senior Network Administrator. As the first employee, I've helped grow the company by nearly 800 client users. We specialize in Microsoft's Office 365 and Azure services.

                I currently live off the southwestern shore of Lake Whatcom with my girlfriend, Zahra, and our two dogs, Loki and Simon, and our cat, Woody. I enjoy camping, hiking, and snowboarding with the occasional game of golf. Musicwise, I'm generally a rock and metal guy, and I play guitar. I'm a die hard Seahawks fan. I'm also a huge movie buff and have seen probably thousands of movies. I'll also be able to quote any of them to you.
